# A+ Programming Language
## Introduction
Welcome to the A+ programming language repository! A+ is a language with a rich history, originally developed over 30 years ago. This project is a fun and ambitious attempt to rejuvenate A+ for contemporary developers, infusing it with the capabilities needed for modern application development. We're not just reviving A+; we're reimagining it for today's programming landscape.

## What's A+?
A+ is a programming language that once stood at the forefront of financial modeling and high-performance applications. Known for its efficient execution and concise syntax, A+ has powered numerous critical systems over the decades. Our mission is to retain the language's core strengths while updating its features and usability for the 21st century.

## Project Goals
Modernize Syntax: Streamlining A+'s syntax to make it more intuitive for today's programmers without losing its distinctive character.

Enhance Performance: Upgrading the runtime and compiler to leverage the latest advancements in computing hardware and software design.

Expand Libraries: Augmenting the standard library with modern functionalities that developers expect in contemporary languages.

Community Engagement: Fostering a vibrant community of A+ developers, new and experienced, to collaborate, innovate, and grow the language's ecosystem.

## Log Notes
[02/26/2024] Repository creation and initial setup. We've started by sifting through the legacy code, identifying components that are outdated or no longer relevant, and preparing the groundwork for modernization.
